**guards= The programs that lock the pc

How it works
============
It generates a file called 1.bat at C:\\. This file contains the code that will 
kill the guards, change the time and then restart the guards.

How does it kill the guards
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The security consist of 2 processes and one service.
WEBMAIN1.exe: The main program. We need to kill this in order to change the time.
svhost2.exe: it restarts the pc if WEBMAIN1.exe is killed.
svchost3: service - seems to work together with svhost2
These 3 watch each other. If you close one of them, the pc restarts
So we suspend the processes, then kill the service.
After that we can safely kill WEBMAIN1.exe change the time and restart it. 

How does it change the time
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Usage
=====
%time%: the timer of the guards is set to this values.
		if set to k, it kills the guards and exits.
		if set to s, it opens a system command promt.
taken from %1 (arg1) or from cin

PsExec pops up a windows and asks you to agree with its licence. I don't like that.
